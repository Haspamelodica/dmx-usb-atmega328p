# HID-based DMX-USB interface running on an Atmega328p

Work-in-progress.

This is an Arduino project aiming to implement an USB-DMX interface compatible with [QLC+](https://qlcplus.org/) via the (preinstalled) UDMX plugin,
by porting the [UDMX](https://anyma.ch/research/udmx/) USB-DMX interface to Atmega328p.

HID-based version: https://github.com/Haspamelodica/dmx-usb-atmega328p-hid/
