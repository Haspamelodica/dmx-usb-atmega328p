# HID-based DMX-USB interface running on an Atmega328p

Work-in-progress.

This is an Arduino project aiming to implement an USB-DMX interface compatible with [QLC+](https://qlcplus.org/) via the (preinstalled) HID plugin,
by using the same protocol as the [FX5](http://fx5.de/) and [Digital Englightment](http://www.digital-enlightenment.de/usbdmx.htm) USB-DMX interfaces.
